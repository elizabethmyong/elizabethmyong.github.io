<strong> I’m a writer and journalist who covers the intersection of food systems and culture. 

I’m currently in the 2025 Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future Food Systems and Public Health Fellowship for Journalists. In 2018, I received a Weisenberger Food Scholarship to study regional cuisine in the Middle East.

Previously, I covered the intersection of money, labor and the economy with food, arts and culture for a journalism partnership between KERA and The Dallas Morning News. I’ve also freelanced for Houstonia Magazine and the Houston Chronicle and worked as a news fellow covering politics and breaking news at CNBC.

My work has been published by APM’s Marketplace, NPR, WBUR’s Here & Now, cnbc.com, Yahoo! Finance, The Houston Chronicle, Associated Press, Houstonia Magazine, Eater NY and Rice Magazine. I was a part of Poynter’s Power of Diverse Voices program in 2021 and was a Poynter-Koch Fellow in 2023-2024. For my innovation project, I tabled at community events and started conversations with people about deep fakes, misinformation and sensationalism.

My reporting on Asian American communities won a regional Edward R. Murrow award and Texas Broadcast News Award. I also reported on Dallas County’s weatherization assistance program for Season 2 of KUT’s award-winning podcast <em>The Disconnect</em> that looks into Texas’ catastrophic 2021 blackout.
